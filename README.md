## CSLabs Hackathon

For the 4th edition of the hackathon of the CSLabs, the organizers decided that the theme would be the Handicap.
This hackathon took place from the 17th of February 2023 to the 19th of February.

## Project Inside Out

The project presented after 48h of brainstorming, drawing, coding and pitching is... "Inside Out" !
The goal of this web application is to bring hidden disabilities back to the fore.
We are talking about all the "dys"orders, but also schizophrenia, eating disorder, ADHD, ...

We want people to experiment a disease in 3 phases :
1. be in their shoes (experience the disorder through an interactive action)
2. inform yourself (read through scientific documentation, reports and synthesis on the disorder)
3. know them better (read through their heart-rending stories, gather some tips, understand how they live with it)

### Team

Behind this idea, not just me but a bunch of incredible people. We named our team `Tech4All` because we want people to know that the technology is made _to support **all** people_ !

This person did an incredible work ; not only did she bring the idea to life with her art skills, but she
also pitched it, created a whole graphical identity, an amazing 30s clip, and also did a lot of research on the different disorders.
